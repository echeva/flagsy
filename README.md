# flagsy

A board game to help kids to learn world countries' flags.

## How to play

Very simple: shuffle all cards, deal 4 to each participant, "big flag picture" up. In turn, each participant proposes one of own card and tries to "guess" to which country it belongs.

If nailed it, the card is discarded, the participant has a card less, if zero he/she wins.

If wrong, the card is discarded, the partipant gets another one from the deck.
